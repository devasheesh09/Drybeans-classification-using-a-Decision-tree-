<h1>Drybeans classification using a Decision tree</h1>

The classification of different dry beans was performed using a Decision tree, with the data being sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/dry+bean+dataset). The implementation is in Python, with the decision tree being created both manually and using the Sickit learn library of Python. The average F1 score obtained in from-the-scratch implementation with 4-fold cross validated data was around 91%, which was almost equal to the scikit learn implementation.
